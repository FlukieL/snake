Basic snake game made with Claude / Other AI tools

This is a simple Snake game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food to grow longer.

## How to Play:

1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or WASD or Gamepad or Touch Input to control the direction of the snake.
2. Eat the food (represented by a red apple) to grow your snake and increase your score.
3. Avoid colliding with the snake's own tail, as this will end the game.
