# Snake

Basic snake game made with Claude / Other AI tools

This is a simple Snake game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food to grow longer. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.

## How to Play:

1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
2. Eat the food (represented by a red apple) to grow your snake and increase your score.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail, as this will end the game.
